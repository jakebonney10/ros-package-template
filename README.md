# ros-package-template

## Overview

This is a template for creating a ROS package. It provides a basic structure and conventions to help you organize your code effectively for your Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) project. By following this template, you can create well-structured ROS packages that are easy to maintain and understand.

## Package Structure

Your package follows a standard ROS package structure:

your_ros_package/
|-- CMakeLists.txt
|-- package.xml
|-- launch/
| |-- your_driver_launch.launch
|-- src/
| |-- your_driver_node.py
|-- msg/
| |-- CustomMsg.msg
|-- srv/
| |-- CustomService.srv
|-- scripts/
| |-- utility_script.py
|-- include/
| |-- your_ros_package/
| |-- init.py
| |-- your_module.py
|-- cfg/
| |-- ExampleConfig.cfg


- `CMakeLists.txt` and `package.xml` are essential for building and describing your package.
- The `launch` directory contains launch files for starting your nodes.
- `src` holds your Python script for your ROS nodes.
- `msg` contains message definition files.
- `srv` contains service definition files.
- `scripts` is for standalone utility scripts.
- `include` is for Python modules.
- `cfg` is for dynamic reconfiguration parameter files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this template repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/your_ros_package.git

2. Customize the package by renaming directories, files, and updating package-specific information in CMakeLists.txt and package.xml.

3. Implement your sensor driver logic in src/your_driver_node.py.

4. Define custom message and service types in msg/ and srv/ as needed.

5. Modify the launch files in the launch/ directory to suit your launch configurations.

6. Customize your Python modules in include/ and add any required logic.

7. Use the provided cfg/ExampleConfig.cfg as a template for dynamic reconfiguration parameters.

## Dependencies
This package depends on the following ROS packages:

- roscpp
- std_msgs
- dynamic_reconfigure (if using dynamic reconfiguration)

Make sure to install these dependencies using rosdep or apt as needed.

## Usage
Use roslaunch to run your nodes with appropriate launch files.

`roslaunch your_ros_package your_driver_launch.launch`

Use rosrun to run standalone scripts or other ROS nodes within your package.

`rosrun your_ros_package your_driver_node.py`
